# Facebook photos backup
A script to download photos from Facebook. 

## Motivation
This script is written to download photos from Facebook. 

For photos in album, Facebook provides an option to download directly. However, to download the photos that you are tagged or you posted on timeline, you have to do it manually. 

This script automates the download process.

Please note that Facebook updates the app frequently so this script may not work when they changed the UI or class names.
